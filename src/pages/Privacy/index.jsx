          <p>
            Some types of information are classified as &lsquo;sensitive&rsquo;
            for the purposes of the GDPR and there are additional restrictions
            on how we may use and hold this information. Sensitive personal

            <li>Alleged or actual criminal convictions and proceedings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The above are merely illustrations and we do not collect the above
            information. However we may, if absolutely necessary, be required to
            collect some information that may be classified as

            consent before we can hold and use such information. However, we may
            hold and use such information without consent for limited statutory
            purposes such as monitoring compliance with our equal opportunities
            policies and health and safety rules, or if necessary to protect
            your vital interests, for legal claims, or in the public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any case, we will make clear the purposes for which we wish to

            Please, kindly note that you are not under obligation to provide the
            personal data to the Organizer. However, provision of the personal
            data by you and its processing by the Organizer are necessary for
            the purposes named under the present Privacy Policy, and to allow

            obligations under the HackAIthon&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions and
            enable you to participate in the HackAIthon. Therefore, failure to

            will be forced to stop your participation in HackAIthon, and in such
            a case we release ourselves from all and any obligations and/or

            <strong>DATA SECURITY</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We have put in place measures to protect the security of your
            information. Details of these measures are available upon request.
            Third parties will only process your personal information on our
            instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information
            confidentially and to keep it secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            We further adopted appropriate security measures to prevent your
            personal information from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed
            in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. We have put in place
            procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will
            notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where
            we are legally required to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those
            employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a
            business need to know. They will only process your personal
            information on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of
            confidentiality.

            <strong>How long will we use and keep your information</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only retain your personal information for as long as
            necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for
            the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
            requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for
            personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
            the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use
            or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
            process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes
            through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the retention period of your personal data lapses, we will
            ensure that your personal data is securely destroyed.
