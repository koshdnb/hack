            the Organizer to lawfully fulfil its respective rights and
            obligations under the HackAIthon’s Terms and Conditions and enable
            you to participate in the HackAIthon. Therefore, failure to provide
            the personal data to the Organizer, may lead to illegality,
            impracticability, and impossibility of cooperation between the
            Organizer and you, as well as it may lead to impossibility to allow

            kindly note that if you decide not to provide the personal data we
            will be forced to stop your participation in HackAIthon, and in such
